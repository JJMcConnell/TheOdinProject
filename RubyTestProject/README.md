#Testing in Ruby

Had to solve problems provided by http://testfirst.org/learn_ruby

They would give you test code and you would write code in order to pass the tests using Rspec. Maybe if I say "Test Driven Development" three times in the mirror with the lights off the magic software engineering fairy will appear from The Cloud and bestow 7 years of Big Data on me and my family. 
Honestly it is a really good method though. 

The Odin Project asked me to solve problems 00 - 04 as well as 08 and 09
I skipped 04 because just reading the pig latin gave me a headache and I accidentally did 05 so we'll call it even.
